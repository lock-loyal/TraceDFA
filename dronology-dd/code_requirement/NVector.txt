- wgs-84 position reckoning, utilize wgs-84 reference system for position reckoning, system. position reckoning utilizes wgs-84 reference system.  
- convert between coordinate systems, allows conversion between n-vector and latitude/longitude/altitude coordinate systems, system. provide bidirectional conversion between n-vector and lla coordinate representations.  
- calculate straight-line distance between points, determine laser-based distance between two n-vector positions, system. compute linear distance between n-vector coordinates.  
- simulate travel path between coordinates, generate interpolated movement path between n-vector positions with configurable step size, system. create simulated travel path between coordinates using specified step distance.  
- validate unit vector normalization, ensure n-vector components form unit vector during instantiation, system. automatically normalize vector components to unit length during object creation.  
- maintain altitude reference consistency, track altitude relative to wgs-84 ellipsoid surface across coordinate conversions, system. preserve altitude measurements during coordinate system transformations.
