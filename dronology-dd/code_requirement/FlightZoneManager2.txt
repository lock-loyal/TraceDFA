- manage pending flight plans, system manages pending flight plans and assigns them to available uavs, system. check for pending flight plans, assign to available uavs when possible.
- enforce maximum uavs in air limit, system ensures number of active uavs does not exceed predefined maximum, system. check active uav count before takeoff, allow takeoff only if below limit.
- handle automatic takeoff clearance, system checks uav readiness and grants takeoff clearance when conditions are met, system. check uav readiness, grant takeoff clearance if conditions satisfied.
- process return to home requests, system processes return to home requests by creating and assigning new flight plans, system. receive return to home request, create flight plan to base coordinate, assign to uav.
- monitor and manage landing readiness, system monitors uavs for landing readiness and initiates landing procedures, system. check uav landing readiness, initiate landing when conditions met.
- schedule periodic status checks, system performs periodic checks on uav status and flight plan progress, system. execute status checks at fixed intervals, update uav states accordingly.
- assign flight plans to designated uavs, system assigns flight plans to specified uavs when available, system. check uav availability, assign designated flight plan when uav becomes available.
- implement emergency stop functionality, system provides emergency stop capability to immediately halt uav operations, system. trigger emergency stop, immediately halt uav movement and operations.
- manage uav state transitions, system manages uav state transitions between flying, awaiting takeoff, and landing states, system. update uav state based on flight plan progress and sensor data.
- coordinate collision avoidance checks, system performs regular collision avoidance checks during flight operations, system. execute collision detection algorithms at fixed intervals, adjust flight paths if needed.
