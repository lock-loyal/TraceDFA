- validate movement precision, ensure drone movement calculations maintain precise distance and altitude during flight, system. calculate next position based on current and target coordinates, validate distance and altitude accuracy within tolerance.
- handle overshooting target waypoint, snap drone position to target when remaining distance is less than travel distance, system. compare remaining and intended travel distance, update position to target if within threshold.
- maintain consistent altitude during flight, keep altitude unchanged when moving between waypoints, system. execute movement between coordinates without altering elevation.
- detect invalid movement requests, identify unreachable targets like antipodal points and return error indicators, system. validate target coordinate feasibility, return invalid position for impossible paths.
