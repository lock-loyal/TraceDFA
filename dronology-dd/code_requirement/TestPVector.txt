- precise geospatial coordinate conversion, ensure accurate conversion between lla and pvector coordinates, system. convert lla coordinates to pvector and back with millimeter-level precision.  
- validate coordinate equality and hashcode, ensure pvector instances with same coordinates are considered equal, system. check equality and hashcode consistency for identical coordinates.  
- handle edge cases in coordinate conversion, verify conversion accuracy at geographical extremes, system. test conversions at poles, international date line, and altitude variations.  
- enforce string representation consistency, maintain standardized string format for pvector coordinates, system. convert pvector to string in fixed decimal format.
