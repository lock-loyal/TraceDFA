- calculate intermediate flight positions, compute precise intermediate positions for uav movement between waypoints using bisection method, system. iteratively adjust position estimates until within 1mm tolerance of target distance.  
- enforce non-negative travel distance, prevent negative travel distance values during position calculation, system. check for negative distance input, throw exception if detected.  
- utilize bisection method for position approximation, apply bisection method to determine accurate intermediate uav positions along flight path, system. calculate midpoint between current and target, adjust bounds based on distance comparison.  
- validate distance before calculation, check if target distance exceeds remaining path length to avoid unnecessary computation, system. compare meters to travel with current-to-target distance, return target if exceeded.
