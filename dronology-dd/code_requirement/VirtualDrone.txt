- simulate uav takeoff procedures, simulates takeoff process including altitude gain and battery drain, system. initiate takeoff sequence, update altitude, start battery consumption.  
- simulate uav flight to specified coordinates, directs uav to follow path from current to target coordinates during simulation, system. define flight path between current and target coordinates, execute movement.  
- simulate uav landing procedures, executes landing sequence including battery drain checkpoint, system. initiate landing, stop battery drain, verify battery checkpoint.  
- monitor simulated battery consumption, track battery level changes during flight operations, system. update battery status during takeoff, flight, and landing phases.  
- simulate incremental uav movement, update position gradually towards target coordinates, system. calculate movement steps, update coordinates iteratively.  
- verify destination reached status, check if uav achieved target coordinates during simulation, system. compare current position with target coordinates, confirm destination attainment.
