- define synchronization points for takeoff phases, establish predefined synchronization checkpoints during takeoff operations, system. during takeoff, reach ascent target, then latitude/longitude position, then first waypoint.  
- define synchronization points for landing phases, establish predefined synchronization checkpoints during landing operations, system. during landing, reach ascent target, then longitude/latitude position, then home location.  
- coordinate multi-drone mission phases through synchronization markers, enable mission planner to synchronize drone activities using predefined synchronization identifiers, mission planner. use synchronization markers to coordinate progress through takeoff/landing sequences.
