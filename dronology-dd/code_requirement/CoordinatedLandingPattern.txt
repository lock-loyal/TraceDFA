- coordinated landing process, defines a predefined pattern for coordinated landing involving multiple waypoints and synchronization points, system. expand flight pattern with ascent to coordination altitude, move to target location at altitude, descend to land, synchronize steps across uavs.  
- altitude coordination for landing, ensure uavs reach a common altitude before proceeding to landing target, system. set coordination altitude, ascend to altitude before moving to target location.  
- synchronization points for landing steps, establish synchronization points to ensure uavs proceed through landing steps in order, system. create sync points for ascent reached, lonlat reached, home reached.  
- waypoint sequence for landing, define sequence of waypoints including ascent, target location at altitude, and final landing point, system. generate waypoints at coordination altitude, target location, landing position.  
- publish landing waypoints to monitoring system, send landing waypoint information to monitoring system for tracking, system. publish waypoint messages to monitoring system upon task creation.
