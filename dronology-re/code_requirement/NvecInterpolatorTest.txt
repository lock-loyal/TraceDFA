- position calculation, compute next position based on current location target and travel distance maintaining consistent altitude, simulation engine. drone movement calculates next position using current location target and specified distance, altitude remains unchanged during movement.  
- target snapping, snap to target position when remaining distance is less than travel distance, simulation engine. travel distance exceeds remaining distance to target, drone position updates to target location.  
- edge case handling, return invalid coordinates when attempting movement across unreachable global positions, simulation engine. movement across opposite earth positions results in invalid coordinates.  
- incremental movement, accumulate small distance increments to approach target location accurately, simulation engine. multiple small distance movements progressively approach target location.
