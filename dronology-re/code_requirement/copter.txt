- drone connection, establish connection to physical or simulated drones based on specified parameters, drone operator. connect to drone via ip or launch simulated instance with home coordinates and speedup.  
- command handling, process incoming drone commands such as set mode takeoff and goto location, drone operator. handle commands only when drone is connected and in responsive state.  
- mode transition, switch drone flight modes including guided land and stabilize, drone operator. transition to loiter mode hands control to rc stabilize triggers guided mode.  
- takeoff procedure, execute takeoff to specified altitude after arming and setting guided mode, drone operator. takeoff requires vehicle to be armable and in guided mode.  
- velocity control, adjust drone velocity using north east down components, drone operator. set velocity via mavlink message for body-frame movement.  
- rtk correction, send real-time kinematic adjustment data to drone for gps accuracy, drone operator. fragment rtk data into packets with sequence numbers.  
- simulation management, launch and manage software-in-the-loop instances for testing, simulation operator. specify instance port home location and simulation speed.  
- emergency handling, stop drone immediately upon critical command or failure, safety officer. emergency stop via specific mavlink commands.
