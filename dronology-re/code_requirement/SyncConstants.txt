- takeoff ascent monitoring, monitor ascent phase completion during takeoff by tracking ascent target waypoint, mission synchronization manager. system tracks when uav reaches ascent target during takeoff.  
- takeoff waypoint synchronization, synchronize mission steps upon reaching first waypoint post takeoff, mission synchronization manager. system triggers next steps when uav reaches first waypoint after takeoff.  
- landing ascent monitoring, track ascent target achievement during landing phase, mission synchronization manager. system monitors uav reaching ascent target during landing.  
- landing coordinate synchronization, coordinate landing steps after uav reaches specified longitude and latitude, mission synchronization manager. system synchronizes landing steps upon reaching target coordinates.  
- home position landing confirmation, confirm landing completion when uav reaches home position, mission synchronization manager. system confirms landing when uav arrives at home position.
