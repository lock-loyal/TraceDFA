- takeoff clearance, manage uav takeoff sequence by checking altitude permissions and airspace capacity, flight zone manager. uav awaits takeoff clearance until altitude permissions granted and maximum in-air limit not exceeded.
- return home command, create automatic flight plan to guide uav back to base coordinates with safe altitude, flight operator. uav returns to home via predefined route when command triggered.
- collision monitoring, perform periodic collision avoidance checks during uav flights, safety system. system executes scheduled collision checks at defined frequency during flight operations.
- emergency stop, immediately halt all uav movements and operations via direct command, flight operator. uav stops all movements instantly when emergency stop triggered.
