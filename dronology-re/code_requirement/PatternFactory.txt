- flight pattern creation, generate predefined flight patterns for coordinated takeoff and landing operations, mission planner. mission planner selects pattern type and factory generates corresponding flight pattern.  
- coordinated takeoff, create flight pattern that synchronizes takeoff procedures across multiple uavs, mission planner. flight pattern ensures uavs take off in coordinated manner.  
- coordinated landing, create flight pattern that synchronizes landing procedures across multiple uavs, mission planner. flight pattern ensures uavs land in coordinated manner.  
- enforce pattern validity, restrict pattern creation to predefined supported types, flight pattern factory. unsupported pattern types trigger error during creation.
