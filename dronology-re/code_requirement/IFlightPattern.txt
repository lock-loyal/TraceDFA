- flight pattern definition, define flight patterns that generate mission tasks based on start and end coordinates, mission planner. flight pattern generates mission tasks using start and end coordinates.  
- task list generation, retrieve list of mission tasks derived from flight pattern, mission execution engine. retrieve list of mission tasks associated with flight pattern.  
- coordinate validation, ensure unique separation between uav start and target positions during pattern expansion, flight safety system. start and target positions must maintain unique separation.  
- synchronization setup, initialize flight pattern with synchronization manager for coordinated missions, mission coordinator. flight pattern initialized with synchronization manager.
