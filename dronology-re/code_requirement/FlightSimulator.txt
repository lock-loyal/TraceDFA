- set flight path, establish flight path between current and target positions for virtual drone, simulation engine. flight path set between current and target positions.  
- compute movement steps, calculate incremental position updates for virtual drone during flight, simulation engine. drone position updated incrementally based on movement steps.  
- destination check, verify if virtual drone has reached target position within defined proximity threshold, simulation engine. target position reached when within proximity threshold.  
- movement direction calculation, determine movement direction using trigonometric angle based on current and target positions, simulation engine. movement direction determined using trigonometric angle.  
- flight path reset, reset flight path when new target assigned or destination reached, simulation engine. flight path reset upon new target assignment or destination reached.  
- error handling, log errors encountered during movement computation steps, simulation engine. errors during movement computation logged.
