- database connection pool configuration, allows the administrator to configure database connection parameters, administrator. administrator modifies connection pool settings in configuration file, system initializes connection pool with updated parameters during startup.  
- automatic connection pool management, system manages database connections to optimize resource usage, administrator. system initializes connection pool during startup using predefined parameters, automatically releases inactive connections after timeout period, maintains maximum pool size limit.  
- connection parameter validation, system validates database connectivity settings during initialization, administrator. system checks database driver availability and connection credentials validity at startup, displays error message for invalid configurations.  
- connection resource recycling, system recycles database connections to maintain availability, administrator. system returns released connections to pool for reuse, tracks active connection durations, enforces maximum active time limit.  
- fail-safe connection defaults, system applies default connection parameters when configuration file is missing, administrator. system uses predefined driver paths, credentials and timeout values if properties file not found, ensures baseline database connectivity.
